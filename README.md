Model-free price bounds under dynamic option trading

Ariel Neufeld, Julian Sester

Abstract:
In this paper we extend discrete time semi-static trading strategies by also allowing for dynamic trading in a finite amount of options, and we study the consequences for the model-independent super-replication prices of exotic derivatives. These include duality results as well as a precise characterization of pricing rules for the dynamically tradable options triggering an improvement of the price bounds for exotic derivatives in comparison with the conventional price bounds obtained through the martingale optimal transport approach.
